I remember when I was restoring pinball machines that I learned a very important lesson about computer repair. 
I accidentally caused mainboard damage to a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_2000[Pinball 2000] (Pin2K) game: https://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?any=star+wars&search=Search+Database&searchtype=quick#4458[Star Wars: Episode 1].  

It is very easy to do, because the two Molex connectors from the ATX power supply were not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector#Keying[keyed], and you could reverse the ground for power. 
I did this, and took out the power circuit on the mainboard.

This was a *big* problem, because the Pin2K mainboards were a BAT-style PC mainboard (running a Cyrix Media GX CPU which was connected to a Cyrix CX5520 bridge). 
These motherboards were used mainly in set-top boxes such as cable TV systems. 
The Pin2K series used a PCI custom card called a PRISM card. 
This card contained all the game logic, sound effects, and video packages for the games. 
If the power spike travelled to the PRISM card, you basically had yourself a fantastic $8000 piece of furniture.

At the time, the machine was mothballed.

I since discovered that http://www.bigguyspinball.com/nucorefeatures.shtml[Big Guys Pinball] have reverse engineered the Pin2K core, and created some custom boards which can be used to replace damaged Pin2K logic box systems. 

The new system is called *nucore*.

The great thing is they are using Linux (Ubuntu), and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf[COTS] motherboards and Video Cards, to make this system a reality. 
You can purchase the components separately, or as a plug-and-play system ready for production use.

Hooray for open source, and ingenuity!

*Update*

Unfortunately the Big Guys at Big Guys Pinball ran into a little bit of strife in 2014 during the pinball resurgence. 
I believe they were kindly asked to discontinue producing these boards because https://www.planetarypinball.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?[Planetary Pinball] had the exclusive rights to reproduce all Bally and Williams parts (including, unfortunately, the Pin2K hardware system). 

But the good news is that *nucore* is available again as of 2017.
It comes in the form of a http://www.bigguyspinball.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1179[Debian package] and there is most definitely "some assembly required".
But where there's Linux, there's hope.
